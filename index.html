So I'm gonna let you crave for me and then some time later I'll take off my pants and show you my huge dick and start moving it on your face while you can't do anything and keep you like that for few minutes but then I'm gonna reveal your mouth and let you get a taste of my dick for good and go fucking crazy and obsessed and addicted to it but then I'm gonna take off your pants unexpectedly and if you thought I would go slow...
